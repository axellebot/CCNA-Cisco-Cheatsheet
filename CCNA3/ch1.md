# CCNA3 - Chapter 1 - Scaling network
## Introduction
- Small company network hierarchy
- Scalability best practices

## Network conception
- Network must be available 99,999% of time
- Need redundancy -> add devices  

3 layers
- core layer
- distribution layer
- access layer

When device crash it's creating a failure area  so we need to anticpate it with scalability.

Link and device redundancy -> limit failure zone
=> loop (using Spanning Tree Protocol to avoid it)

EtherChannel -> link aggregation

To scale we can use :
- WLAN
- OSPF multiple area

## Network devices
- Seted switch :
  - Size width : rack unit
- Modular switch

- Price
- Port density (port count)
- Power Over Ethernet (POE)
- Fiability
- Scalability
