# CCNA2 - Chapter 11 - NAT (Network Address Translation)

PAT when only 1 dynamic address ?

## Caracteristics
Address types :
- Inside local
- Inside global
- Outside local
- Outside global

3 types of NAT translation :
- Static NAT
- Dynamic NAT
- Overload NAT => PAT

## Static NAT
Mapping inside local with outside global
```
`ip nat {inside|outside} source static <inside|outside-local> <inside|outside-global>

interface <int>
ip nat {inside|outside}
```

## Dynamic NAT
Mapping inside local with  outside global (1 of the pool)
First arrived first used (default : during 1 day)
```
ip nat pool <pool-name> <first-ip> <last-ip> [netmask <netmask>]
//create standard ACL
ip nat {inside | outside} source list <ACL#> pool <pool#>

interface <int>
ip nat {inside|outside}
```

## Overload NAT = PAT
Mapping inside local and port with outside globla with port.
If port already used, increment

PAT can foward protocol which not using port number ( like ICmP -> using request id)

With multiple public address (use pool) :
```
ip nat pool <pool-name> <first-ip> <last-ip> [netmask <netmask>]
//create standard ACL
ip nat {inside | outside} source list <ACL#> pool <pool#> overload

interface <int>
ip nat {inside|outside}
```

With one public address (interface) :

```
ip nat pool <pool-name> <first-ip> <last-ip> [netmask <netmask>]
//create standard ACL
ip nat {inside | outside} source list <ACL#> interface <interface> overload

interface <int>
ip nat {inside|outside}
```
## Redirection
Enable redirection
```
ip nat inside source static tcp <private-address> <private-address>  <address-public> <public-port>

interface <int>
ip nat {inside|outside}
```

## IPv6
use NAT64 (6 to 4)

## Troubleshooting NAT
`ip nat translation timeout <timeout-seconds>`
`show ip nat translations` : Show nat translations
`clear ip nat translations` : lear nat translations
`clear ip nat statistics` : Clear statistics
`debug ip nat` :
